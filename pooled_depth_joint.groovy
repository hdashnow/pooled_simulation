// Bpipe pipeline
// Harriet Dashnow 22 March 2015
// Takes mapped exome bams. Simulates pooled exomes.
// Simulates pools by simply taking all reads from the individual samples and pooling them together
// with no downsampling. e.g. a pool of 10 samples, each with 100x coverage would end up with 1000x coverage
